# Shoptopia

Shoptopia is an e-commerce platform where users can browse, add, and view products. It includes optimized backend and frontend features to provide a seamless and secure shopping experience, including user authentication, password hashing, and image storage with AWS. An admin panel is available for managing products efficiently.

Check out the live version of the application [here](https://shoptopia-frontend.vercel.app/) to explore its features.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: JWT-based authentication to secure user data and link items added to the specific user.
- **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt, making it difficult to decrypt even if the database is compromised.
- **Image Storage**: AWS S3 is used to store product images efficiently.
- **Optimized Backend**:
  - **Rate Limiting**: Limited to 100 requests on AWS and a 2MB upload limit to reduce potential traffic bottlenecks.
  - **Validation**: Zod validation for input sanitization and error handling.
  - **Error Handling**: Comprehensive `try-catch` blocks implemented for stability.
- **Admin Panel**: Manage products with add and view functionalities through a dedicated admin interface.
- **Frontend Optimizations**:
  - Debouncing on the login page inputs to reduce unnecessary re-renders.
  - Context API and Recoil for state management.
  - Framer Motion for smooth animations.
  - Gsap for Pre-loader animation.
